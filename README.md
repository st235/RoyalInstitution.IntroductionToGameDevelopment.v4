# Legend of Royal Institution: WebIDE

Welcome to the **Legend of Royal Institution Online IDE**,
an educational tool designed for introducing students to the world of game development through a hands-on,
text-configurable maze game.

This project is used in workshops delivered in collaboration with [the **Royal Institution**](https://www.rigb.org)
and built to demystify how games are made - from gameplay mechanics to level design and AI behavior.

---

## Workshop Learning Plan

### 1. What Makes Up a Video Game?
- **Gameplay** – How the player interacts with the game.
- **Mechanics** – The rules and systems (e.g., keys open doors, coins increase score).
- **End Goal** – What does it mean to win or finish the game?

### 2. Playthrough & Analysis
- Play the sample maze and try to understand its rules.
- Brainstorm 2–3 mechanics you'd like to add that aren't in the game yet.

### 3. Building a Custom Level
- Learn about config/data-driven design.
- Understand wall configuration and layout logic.
- Create your own tile config.
- Design your own maze.

### 4. Adding Mechanics
- Revisit mechanic ideas and choose a few to implement.
- Add coin tiles.
- Assign different point values to different coins.
- Introduce doors and keys.

### 5. Design Challenge
- Place doors and keys in a way that makes the level interesting.
- Refine and test a custom labyrinth.

### 6. Thinking About AI
- What would a monster do? Where would it go?
- Prototype custom monster behavior in text config.

### 7. Misc – Spice It Up!
- Add easter eggs or secret levels.
- Add additional constraints like a move limit, timer, or collectibles challenge.


## Educational Goals

By the end of this workshop, students will:

- Understand the structure of a video game
- Modify game mechanics and level design using data/config files
- Explore how games respond to user input and rules
- Experiment with AI-like behavior and gameplay balance
- Express creativity through level building and gameplay tweaks
