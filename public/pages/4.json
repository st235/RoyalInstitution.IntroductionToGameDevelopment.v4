These values will control how each wall tile appears in the final rendered game.</p><p>You can be creative here! Think of these tile IDs as different styles or textures: cracked stone, mossy brick, or a broken piece of wall. Just be sure to keep the order consistent with how you'll use <code>W0</code>, <code>W1</code>, etc., in your maze layout.</p><p>Below is an image to help you identify tiles in your game.</p><img src=\"@public/tiles-examples-walls.png\" width=\"500\"></img><a class=\"button\" href=\"@public/tiles-examples-full.png\" target=\"__blank\"><img src=\"@public/icons/arrow-up-right-square-fill.svg\" />See full tilemap</a>"
