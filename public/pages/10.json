These constraints help shape the difficulty and strategy of your level—forcing players to plan carefully, move efficiently, or collect more before they can win.</p><p>You can adjust the following values:</p><ol><li><strong>Max time (in seconds)</strong>: the total amount of time a player has to complete the level.</li><li><strong>Max moves</strong>: the maximum number of moves the player can make.</li><li><strong>Minimum score</strong>: the minimum score the player must collect before the flag appears in the level.</li></ol><p>Here's an example configuration:</p><pre> Max time: 60<br>Max steps: 200</pre><p>With this setup, the player has 60 seconds and 200 moves available to completel the level.</p><p>Ready to tweak your level's challenge? Enter your constraint values below and test how they change the gameplay experience!</p>"
