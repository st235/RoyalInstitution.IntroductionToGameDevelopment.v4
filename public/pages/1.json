In this step, you will play <span class=\"logo\">the Legend of Royal Institution</span> (a maze game) and observe how it behaves.</p><p>Put on your game designer hat and figure out how the game works. The following questions will help you to start:</p><ul><li>What are the rules of the maze?</li><li>How does the player move through it?</li><li>What marks the end of the game?</li></ul><p>Use the <strong>text boxes below</strong> to jot down any rules, patterns, or interesting game mechanics you notice.</p><p>As you explore the game, start thinking about how you could make it more interesting or challenging. What new <strong>game mechanics</strong> could you add? Think about how these elements could change the way the game is played and how they might make it more fun or challenging.</p><p>P.S.: There are no wrong answers! This is all about being curious and observant.</p>"
