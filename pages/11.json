Now it's time to give it a name and add some <strong>special effects</strong> to make it truly stand out!</p> <p>In this exercise, you'll set the <strong>title of your level</strong> and optionally apply <strong>post-processing effects</strong> that change how it looks and feels during gameplay.</p><p>There are three settings to configure:</p><ol><li><strong>Level title:</strong> enter a short, catchy name for your level. The title is displayed in the top right corner of the level.</li><li><strong>Cathode Ray Tube Effect:</strong> toggle this on to apply a subtle screen distortion and scan-line effect, similar to the look of an old CRT television. Great for retro vibes 📺</li><li><strong>Fog of War Effect:</strong> toggle this on to restrict player visibility, revealing only areas near the player's position. Perfect for sprinking more challenge.</li></ol><p>With this setup, your level will start with a dramatic, old-TV aesthetic and players will only see the immediate area around them—making exploration more intense</p>"
